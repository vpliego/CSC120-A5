Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

Before I began the assignment, it seemed fairly simple. However, as soon as I reached the Boot.java file, I began facing a bit of difficulty with understanding the hints and putting them to use when trying to make my boots for the scarecrow. After this, though, I was also a bit nervous about how I'd be able to message to display inside of the ASCII art speech bubble. After a lot of trial and error, I was able to get a pattern down that would take in the length of the message and then be able to either add two or four asterisks beside it. I am also experiencing a bit of issues with VS Code and it running consistently so I turned to my laptop's terminal to check if the code was working correctly. It seems to work just fine in the terminal, though, I am a bit confused on why it seems to have a harder time on VS code. There are also some extra files with .class that I'm unsure on how they got to my project but I will leave them there in case it is storing something vital to the code. To sum up, though there were a couple tricky components to the assignment, I did get a better idea of association and how important/helpful it is.
